We have developed a hardware based software which helps to make it possible that a person having no driving license would not be able to drive the vehicle with a three step authentication process. As the person scans his/her Driving license to the RFID Scanner then all the data at that id present at the RTO would be stored into the database of the car then that person need to scan his/her fingerprint at the fingerprint scanner if it matches then the person need to verify his/her face at the installed face camera as soon as the face is detected the car ignition would start and the person would be able to drive the car . But is the camera detects another face after the ignition then after 3 warning the car owner and the RTO would be notified about the false detection

You need to run the interface file and if all the connections are perfect the it would be working in the perfect flow
